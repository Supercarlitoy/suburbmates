# Phase 0: Exact Commands to Execute

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Next Steps

### **1. Clone Your Repository**
```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/Supercarlitoy/suburbmates.git
cd suburbmates
```

### **2. Copy Phase 0 Files**
You need to copy all the files from the Phase 0 project I created. Here are the exact commands:

**Option A: If you have access to the zip file I'll create:**
```bash
# Extract the zip file to your repository
# (Download and extract suburbmates-phase0.zip to your local machine)
# Then copy all contents to your cloned repository
```

**Option B: Manual file creation (if needed):**
```bash
# Create the basic structure
mkdir -p src/components src/pages src/lib docs/sessions

# You'll need to create each file manually using the content I provided
# All file contents are documented in the session documentation
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Install all required packages
npm install

# Install development dependencies
npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss autoprefixer
```

### **4. Test Locally**
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
# Verify the SuburbMates welcome page loads correctly
```

### **5. Commit to GitHub**
```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit Phase 0
git commit -m "Phase 0: Foundation infrastructure and welcome page

- React 18+ with Vite build system
- Professional SuburbMates branding and design
- Vercel deployment configuration
- Complete project structure for future phases

## ðŸš€ After Phase 0 Completion

Once you confirm Phase 0 is working:
1. **Send me your live Vercel URL** for verification
2. **Confirm all sections display correctly**
3. **Test on mobile device**
4. **Ready to proceed to Phase 1** (User Authentication & Profiles)

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. **Check the browser console** for error messages
2. **Verify all files were copied correctly**
3. **Ensure npm install completed successfully**
4. **Check that your GitHub repository has all the files**

The Phase 0 foundation is designed to work immediately once properly set up. Any issues are likely related to file copying or dependency installation.
